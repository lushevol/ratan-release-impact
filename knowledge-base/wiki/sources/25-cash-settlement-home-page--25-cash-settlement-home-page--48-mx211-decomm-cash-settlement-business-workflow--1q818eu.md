# MX2.11 Decommission: Cash Settlement Business Workflow — Settlement Touchpoints

## Source status

This is a discovery-oriented business workflow inventory for China Day 1 and the target migration from MX2.11 to [[ratan]]. It records current operational practices, proposed target capabilities, dependencies, and unresolved items. It is not an approved design, implementation plan, policy, or test record.

The source does not consistently distinguish current state, China Day 1 scope, and future target state. Statements marked `TBC`, `TBD`, `??`, or `-do-` require validation before they are used as requirements or operational controls.

## Key observations

- [[ratan]] is proposed as the orchestration platform for selected payment processing, NSTP/STP, confirmation-led release, affirmation notifications, validation, reporting, and exception handling.
- Mandatory cashflow affirmation is proposed to be reduced for eligible flows through trade-level Confirmation Match status, notification, and S2B NG integration. The source also says to continue Outlook-based affirmation, so the intended segmentation is unresolved.
- Automation depends on client eligibility static, data sourced from SCI, SSI+ controls, AMH RMA checks, and several governance decisions.
- Commodity, CDS, China CCS, bond, and related product-specific settlement paths remain unresolved and are assigned to CTMU, CMS, or Clearing-team collaboration.
- Product- and client-specific suppression behavior is recorded, but identifiers, statuses, accounting outcomes, and ownership are incomplete.
