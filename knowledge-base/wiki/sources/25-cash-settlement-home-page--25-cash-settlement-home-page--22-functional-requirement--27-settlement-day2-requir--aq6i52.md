# Archival and Retrieval — Settlement Day 2 Requirement

## Summary

This document is an incomplete requirements worksheet for cashflow archival, retention, retrieval, and search behavior in the [[cash-settlement-home-page]]. It proposes hot, warm, cold, and purged data states, but the country-specific lifecycle matrix and all question responses are blank.

The proposed architecture distinguishes logical retrieval from physical storage:

- Hot data is proposed for the most recent six months in the Production Database.
- Warm data is proposed for the period from six months to five years in the Archival Database.
- Cold data is proposed for offline storage after five years until the applicable country retention schedule expires.
- Purged data has no defined duration or operational requirement.

The document also proposes routing searches by value date, removing the existing 30-day search limitation in favor of a result-volume threshold, and potentially preventing updates to cashflows whose value date is more than six months old.

## Retention Matrix

The lifecycle columns are intentionally preserved as blank because the source does not provide approved country-specific requirements.

## Evidence and Unresolved Tensions

The six-month and five-year durations are proposed in the table header, not approved policy. The document does not define whether retention is based on value date, trade date, trade expiry, settlement date, or another timestamp.

A key tension exists between the six-month retrieval boundary and the rule that movement from hot to warm data can occur only after 15 months of trade expiry. The six-month rule may be a logical query-routing boundary while the 15-month rule controls physical movement, but the source does not confirm this interpretation.

Other unresolved issues include country-specific retention and purge schedules, the meaning of FMID, the normalization of country and location mappings, SLA requirements, result thresholds, pagination and export behavior, and permitted remediation of historical cashflows.
