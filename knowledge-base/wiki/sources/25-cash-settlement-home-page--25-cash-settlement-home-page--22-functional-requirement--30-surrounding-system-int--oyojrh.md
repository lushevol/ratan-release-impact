# Murex 2.11 Payment Non-STP Exceptions

This functional requirement describes the legacy `Murex2.11` Payment STP rule sequence and the proposed treatment of rule failures in RATAN and FMRP.

In Murex2.11, each eligibility failure adds an exception code to the cashflow `REASON` column. Multiple codes can be attached to one cashflow, and any exception prevents Payment STP. The target approach is selective rather than a one-for-one recreation: some controls become RATAN NSTP conditions, some use FMRP amendment handling, and others remain in Murex2.11, are excluded from Day 1, or are deferred to Day 2.

## Source rule catalogue

| | Rule Generate Exception Code | Scenario | FMRP Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | INTER NET | Murex perfrom auto netting for internal entity cashflow for which the STP should not process. There is static table defined entity&ctp used for checking auto netting eligibility. China entity is not applied. | Auto Netting not yet built in RATAN. Entities moved out of MX2.11 will be removed from MX2.11 Auto Netting |
| 2 | FIXING | If fixed cashflow has a respective cashflow from estimated floating cashflow, cashflow will be excluded from STP with exception code 'FIXING' (Fixed leg should not be STP-ed, but wait for floating leg and perform NET before settlement.) | In RATAN, fixing products like IRS is tagged as NSTP with exception (Example: MUREX IRS) |
| 3 | AMOUNT LIMIT TYPE | Payment STP only process cashflow amount (dollar equivalent) below threshold (2 mio by default). Amount above threshold will tag exception code as 'AMOUNT'. Threshold is configrable in static table setup. Pay/Rec limit type set in counterparty udf (field PAY_STP,REC_STP). If ctp limit type is not config-ed as 'limited' or 'unlimited', will tag exception code as 'LIMIT TYPE'. Threshold is setup in TABLE#LIST#PAYTHRES_DBF per limit type. | Threshold based STP will not be used |
| 4 | CP_EXCL | For Fx precious metal trade, define counterparts for which the STP should not process in static table. Counterparty list defined in PAYSTP_EXCP_DBF table. | Where required, specific scenarios to be setup as NSTP based on the business case (example: DVP) |
| 5 | PROD | Define Family, Group, Type, typology, strategy combination for which the STP should not process in static table UDF Table: TABLE#LIST#PAY_STPN_DBF | Where required, specific scenarios to be setup as NSTP based on the business case (example: DVP) |
| 6 | STRAT | Define strategys which is eligible for payment STP in static table TABLE#LIST#PAY_STRA_DBF | CN:TRS NSTP will be covered via CORP exception. No other requirements Where required, specific scenarios to be setup as NSTP based on the business case (example: DVP) |
| 7 | CURR | define currency which is eligible to STP or not in static table Ccy eligibility identification: Currency UDF filed TABLE#DATA#CURRENCY_DBF.M_PAYSTP | Where required, specific scenarios to be setup as NSTP based on the business case (example: DVP) |
| 8 | ENTITY | For internal trade(ie. Trade booked with ctp type is 'Internal'), the related payments can be STPed only if both entities have a payment module. static table TABLE#LIST#PAYSTP_M_DBF setup for entities that payment mode is enabled. | N/A |
| 9 | STP_HOLD | Hold the payments if entry match with STP_HOLD UDT. TABLE#LIST#STP_HOLD_DBF config combination of Entity + ctp+ + family+ group+ type+ typo + currency + strategy + pay/rec | Where required, specific scenarios to be setup as NSTP based on the business case (example: DVP) |
| 10 | NDS | If casfflow is generated from NDS fixing, and ccy is non-deliverable, should be excluded from payment STP. NDS fixing cashflow Iendification: typology='NDS Fixing' and Strategy='FEDSVALIDATOR' and TABLE#DATA#PAYFLOW_DBF.M_NID >0 | ND currency will be retained in MX2.11. Only deliverable ccy cashflow will be sent to RATAN |
| 11 | LIEN | Check for Lien trades. STP don't process Lien trade. Lien trade identification: Trade UDF field M_LIEN_MONIT = N or null | Create NSTP Condition in RATAN |
| 12 | PX_CAP | Check for Conservative trades. STP don't process conservative trades. conservative trades identification: Trade UDF filed M_PRICE_CAP is not null | @Yi Li to check this is applied to which entity - **Completed** >>Conservative trade booked for below entities with low volume (year 2022) China- 88 DUBAI-200 UK-97 KL-4 @Cordelia Sumita K Thirunavukarasu Not required for CN Day1 N/A for SG/MY/IN/UK/DE |
| 13 | NET | The payments eligible for counterpart netting must not flow down STP. In order to identify them a configuration table TABLE#LIST#PAYSTP_N_DBF allow to specify the combination of Counterparty, family, group, type, typology and strategy for which Ops may do counterpart netting/CPN and the settlement should therefore not go STP. | Net exception will be triggered in RATAN |
| 14 | CORP | this exception code is taggeed when counterparty type is non-bank and non-internal. Ctp type identification: Ctp UDF filed M_CTRTY_TYPE One more static table defined STP type for spefic ctp type. (TABLE#LIST#TYPE_CTR_DBF). STP is eligible when STP type is Bank or Internal | CORP exception will be triggered in RATAN |
| 15 | CLEARING STATUS | for IRD trades sourced from Markitware/Eclipse and yet to be clearing-ed, correspoding cashflow should be excluded from STP. | @Yi Li to check this is applied to which entity. **Completed** >>Not in Chian Day1 scope. Mostly found under UK, few under MUBAI sample payment id: 88332965,88332966,91779977,83073860,88382771,91798295,85043205,85038570 @Cordelia Sumita K Thirunavukarasu Not required for CN Day 1 SG/MY: Not used in MX2.11 for SG/MY/IN |
| 16 | CROSS-NET | this exceptIon code is tagged when cashflow got Netted by payment 'NDS Invoicing (NINV)' or 'INTER ENTITY NET (ICIV)' payment queue INTER ENTITY NET is not China related, it is used for internal entity netting. (ctp+entity static table based) NDS Invoicing is used by China entity to do Cross Netting for products between NDS and FXD out of NDS fixing | NDS Invoicing queue - @Cordelia Sumita K Thirunavukarasu Not required for CN Day1 SG/MY: Not required as ND ccy will not be sent to RATAN UK/DE: Not required |
| 17 | S&M | Scan&Modify was perfomed on trade and impacting this cashflow | All Entities: Follow existing amendment logic in FMRP |
| 18 | SI | Missing nostro or vostro SI | RATAN will trigger Missing / Multi Vostro exception |
| 19 | SI(AWI) | if cashflow vostro field 57 (Account With Institution) is not given, payment STP should not happen | @Wayne Wang to check in Ratan if 57 is mandatory to fill up in SI. (check all mandatory field in Ratan) @Cordelia Sumita K Thirunavukarasu Not required for CN Day 1. RATAN will rely on SSI+ data. GUI exception exists for many key in. |
| 20 | SI(MUL) | if counterparty has multiple si defined in murex, payment STP should not happen, even if the multiple SSI available in the counterparty is not assigned to current payment flow.As long as the key fields match the payment details and the SSI can be selected by system or manually, it will be considered. | RATAN will trigger Multi Vostro exception |
| 21 | MOP | If cashflow is gnereated from market operation (CnR, Restructure, Exercise, Early termination), MOP was not validated or was done within last 7 days should not STP payment | All Entities: Follow existing amendment logic in FMRP |
| 22 | XIT | this exception indicate flow from Simple option deal is NOT from premium. Only Premium for CURR OPT SMP to be STP-ed. | STP in RATAN. Exception 'Reversal' will be triggered only if payment already released from RATAN |
| 23 | STATUS | for RMF clients, system will process payment STP only when trade has been matched (status=COMP). Otherwise will tag exception code as STATUS. If RMF trade only failed the STATUS check, system will auto re-process it in subsequent STP procedure. RMF clients will be identified by UDF 'ATLAS Sub-segment' field when value is P5 or P6 China has RMF trades | @Cordelia Sumita K Thirunavukarasu Not required for Day1 @Wayne Wang to check if ratan receive this filed 'ATLAS Sub-segment' from SCI H1 & H2 2024 Go Live: MX2.11 trade COMP status will be consumed from TDS3. If not matched, RATAN will display 'Pending Affirmation' exception |
| 24 | REV | this exception code is tagged when cashflow is a reversal flow, but original flow has NOT been settled (status<>SENT), or market operation is has not validated. | All Entities: Follow existing amendment logic in FMRP. Reversal exception will be triggered if amendment happens post payment release in RATAN. If outright cancellation, it wil be STP. |
| 25 | COMMENT | if cashflow belong to a trade having comment, by default it should not STP, unless static table config it as 'ignore comment'. (Note: this NSTP code is defined in murex on code level but not found on any business payment, we put it here for reference purpose in case RATAN want to build for strategic flow) | @Cordelia Sumita K ThirunavukarasuDay 2 requirement In backlog, will be built only for BLADE trades |
| 26 | XAU, XAG, XU5, XS9 | Trades are manually processed. SUPP in MX. GLTE switch between Bullion PSGL to DVSUS | Day 2 requirement. If Bullion is added to Day1 scope, this needs to covered in Recon squad |

## Scope cautions

The stated mappings have different applicability for China Day 1, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Germany, Dubai, and KL. They do not establish that a given control is enabled in production.

Notable unresolved boundaries include RATAN field 57 requirements, `ATLAS Sub-segment` delivery from SCI, TDS3 `COMP` status consumption, exception precedence, and the authoritative RATAN condition names.
