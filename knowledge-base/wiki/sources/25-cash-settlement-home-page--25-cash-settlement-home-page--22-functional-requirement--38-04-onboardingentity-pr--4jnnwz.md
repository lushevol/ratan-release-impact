# FMRP Prime UK UAT Drop 2 — Prime Day 2 Checklist

## Scope

This source is a functional-requirement and UAT onboarding checklist for **FMRP Prime UK - UAT Drop 2 - FM re-platforming**. The products explicitly covered are IRS, CCS, and Loan Depo. The principal systems and integrations are FMRP, Murex, RATAN, STELLA, RAZOR, Aspire, EBBS, SWIFT, and CDUPS.

The checklist defines intended test scenarios and expected results. It does **not** establish that tests were executed or passed. It contains no execution dates, test-case identifiers, pass/fail results, defect references, evidence attachments, sign-off owners, or go-live approval.

## Key acceptance areas

- SSI auto-stamping, CFI-code selection, settlement-method selection, agent support, trade SSI stamping to CDUPS, and Nostro auto-stamping.
- Group Pending and Group Pending Validation state transitions, including routing to the Settlement Queue and filtering for the rates derivatives team.
- SWIFT MT and MX generation, including replay by the Dev team because downstream connectivity is unavailable.
- EBBS real-time and EOD accounting feeds, Aspire integration, historic cashflows, and post-cutover past-value events.
- IRS interest auto-netting, ND IRS handling, Markitwire allocation behavior, clearing-portfolio suppression, and cross-product netting between STELLA and Murex cashflows.
- Murex-to-STELLA replication of NSTP, SWIFT suppression, and cashflow suppression rules.
- Murex-to-FMRP migration, duplicate-payment prevention, cutover handling, and historical-data handling.
- Loan Depo pending-fixing configuration and GUI visibility.
- UK SSI hierarchy precedence and SGO-to-SGD non-ISO currency mapping.

## Important scope boundaries and risks

The `UK MXGBLANK` SSI is described as being selected instead of the Global IRS SSI; the checklist does not show whether this issue was resolved. Blank applicability fields are ambiguous and must not be interpreted as either in scope or out of scope without confirmation.

The checklist marks BIC Netting, NDS Auto Netting, DVP, Vostro SSI screen settlement-means changes, and rounding as not applicable in the stated Prime context. Principal plus Interest Netting is marked not applicable generally, while internal counterparties are described as in scope. NDS Auto Netting behavior is retained as contextual information only and is not a Prime acceptance criterion unless the scope changes.

Replay-based UAT generation does not prove live downstream delivery, acknowledgment, or reconciliation. Murex and STELLA rule parity is a requirement, not demonstrated evidence.

| | Nostro Auto Stamping | - Default Nostro Stamping | | | | - Correct nostro is picked as expected |
| | Dashboard | | | | | - Cashflows do not get stuck in Group Pending |
| | Grouping Blotter | - Group Pending - Group Pending Validation | | | | - No Cashflows get stuck as Group Pending - Cashflows are stuck as Group Pending Validation prior to Validation & when validated they flow to Settlement Queue - **Able to use filter for rates derivatives team** |
| | Cashflow Blotter | - New Fields introduced for Murex Flow - LIEN - Pending Fixing - Duplicate NDS - LTID, Structure ID, NID - Commodity Flag - Alpha Clearing | - New Fields Required - Murex Fields Equivalent in FMRP | No | None of these are part of scope | - |

| | Accounting Generation | - EBBS - Real Time Feed - ASPIRE Integration - EOD Feed | - Keystone (HK): Feed Nostro & Over Account to EBBS, feed Suspense to Aspire - Move from Aspire to EBBS model - handling of historic cashflows & events on past value cashflows post cutover | | | - No Accounting Errors (No downstream connectivity so engage Dev team to replay in UAT env) |
