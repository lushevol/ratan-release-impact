# *Overview*

## *Introduction*

Currently Derivative trades and cashflows are processed in MXG 2000 (Murex2.11 or MX2.11) system, which is a legacy system and in the process of decommission due to obsolescence risk. The FM re-platforming programme is implementing a decommissioning strategy which will migrate cashflow to the FM target platforms (RATAN) for settlements processing, including cashflow lifecycle management, SSI Stamping, Netting process, Suppression, Hold/Unhold, USD Limit Control and etc. The decommission will be phases and first phase is to migrate Murex 2.11 cash settlements of CHINA to FMRP strategic cash stack in Nov 2023 ahead of the Trade Migration which is planned for 2024.

## SWIFT Generation

Effective Jul 2024, RATAN will generate SWIFT message directly for selected entities and sent to FM Swift Gateway (FMSGW). (LOANIQ,EG,NP,SA swift are still generated by Razor)

RATAN will generate SWIFT only if Settlement Means is 'NOS' or 'Over-Account'. For other Settlement Means (Example: WMSUS), SWIFT will not be generated.

For deals requiring settlement to wealth management suspense, the cashflow must be settled to Settlement Means 'WMSUS' and Settlement Account also as 'WMSUS'. Existing SSI's with WM/AEB flag have already been updated in SSI+ as 'WMSUS' in Settlement Means and Account

How to check cashflow's SWIFT Message

- In Cashflow details, it has SWIFT Message tab on the top, which will provide the SWIFT Message if released.
- MT message generated by Ratan (CN,MY,IN,SG) - downstream is FMSGW. Field 20 reference will start with DV
- MT message generated by Razor (LOANIQ, EG, NP, SA) - downstream is FMSRE. Field 20 reference for Loaniq will start with LQ and for EG/NP/SA it will start with FX.
- In future, MX message will be generated by Ratan - downstream will be TBC
- [Details can be found in ](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/FMRP+Swift+Generation)<u>[FMRP Swift Generation - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence (standardchartered.com)](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/FMRP+Swift+Generation)</u>

Sample of SWIFT Message below.

![image2024-6-25_16-14-35.png](attachments/image2024-6-25_16-14-35.png)

New fields have been added to Cashflow Blotter to show the SWIFT message type and the status of the SWIFT (Not applicable for LOANIQ, EG,NP,SA)

Notes: In case of any pre-validation failure (e.g. status is not expected, duplication check), Cashflow Swift Status will be showing as 'Ratan Internal Error', the main Cashflow State will have no change as RELEASED. If this happens, need to check Swift tabs via cashflow details to see if Swift message generated or not.

![image2024-6-28_14-39-48.png](attachments/image2024-6-28_14-39-48.png)

In case of any errors in SWIFT generation or in downstream, it will be shown in Dashboard (Not applicable for LOANIQ, EG,NP,SA)

![image2024-6-28_14-18-42.png](attachments/image2024-6-28_14-18-42.png)

### Guidelines for Routing Number capture in SWIFT

![image-2025-3-27_20-6-29.png](attachments/image-2025-3-27_20-6-29.png)

### Cross Border Debit

- For <u>receive</u> flow, if settlement account is in format “CCY CROSSDEBIT” (such as USD CROSSDEBIT), then follow below swift mapping
- | Swift Tag | Field Name | Mandatory | MT202 CROSSDEBIT SI mapping | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Block1 | Message sender | Y | Vostro SI 57BIC | | Block2 | Message receiver | Y | Vostro SI 57BIC | | 52 | Ordering Institution | Y | Vostro SI Bene detail (58) | | 53 | Sender's Correspondent | Y | bene Account in vostro (58) | | 57 | Account With Institution | Y | Nostro agent BIC (53) | | 58 | Beneficiary Institution | Y | Legal entity BIC |
- no impact to accounting process
- the cashflow feed will be sent to LMS, if new entity onboard the cross border debit account, need to inform LMS to config the mapping

More details updated to [FMRP Swift Generation - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/FMRP+Swift+Generation)

## Accounting Generation

(Not applicable for LOANIQ, EG,NP,SA)

Effective Jul 2024, RATAN will generate Accounting message directly for selected entities (CN, IN, SG, MY) and sent to eBBS via real time feed.

How to check cashflow's accounting Detail

- In Cashflow details, it has accounting detail tab on above, which will provide the accounting details if cashflow is in RELEASED/SETTLED/FAILED/SWIFT_SUPPRESSED status.
- If payment has reached value date, accounting will be in SENT status; else will be in HOLD status and waiting for value date, 6 AM local time on VD will be sent to EBBS.

If the value is true, cashflow will be in WAITING + Pending another leg status.

- Once floating cashflow C2 is fixed in Murex, C1 & C2 will be auto netted as N1 in Murex.
- Then Murex will send C1 reversal and N1 to RATAN.

If the value is false, cashflow will go through rest checking for STP.

**Clearing Alpha**

Indicator from Murex 2.11 to mark  if the cashflow C1 is pending to be cleared。

## SSI ID population

- system auto stamped SI: SSI ID is populated
- user manually enter vostro SI: SSI ID is blank
- User select from available SI and submit without any changes: system set the SSI ID value with the selected SI ID.
- For auto stamped SI or user selected SI, - user update only 70/72 values, - system will keep the SSI ID - system will highlight "Field 70/72 Customized" as below (only highlight 70/72 update when SSI ID exist and user updated 70/72; if no SSI ID, no such highlight field show up.) ![](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/download/attachments/3722335608/image-2026-7-8_14-37-30.png?version=1&modificationDate=1783492651000&api=v2) - user update values other than 70/72 fields, system will remove the SSI ID

- Released Status : Normally these should move to SETTLED when Ack'd by AMH

![Released.JPG](attachments/Released.JPG)

- Ready Status: If Sub Status is 'NA', it means that the cashflow is not yet released from RATAN, waiting for release time. If the sub status is Pending Ack, then it means that cashflow has been sent to RAZOR and waiting for Ack.

![image2023-11-10_10-44-27.png](attachments/image2023-11-10_10-44-27.png)

- Hold Status : Put on hold by a user previously

![Hold.JPG](attachments/Hold.JPG)

- ERROR status: Mandatory attributes required by RATAN are not received. Normally this is not expected to happen. But if encountered, raise the issue to RATAN PSS if unable to identify the reason. If it's a MX2.11 cashflow and the missing field is known, raise the issue to MX2.11 PSS.

![image2023-11-10_18-12-10.png](attachments/image2023-11-10_18-12-10.png)

Note: If there are more than 500 records, only the first 500 records are being displayed. If any column filters are selected, they will be applied only within the records displayed, not on the entire population. Warning is provided on screen to indicate this.

User should apply filters to reduce the results below 500 if they intend to view all cashflows fitting within a criteria

![500 cashflows.JPG](attachments/500 cashflows.JPG)

As an example below, there are totally 90050 cashflows, but only first 500 are displayed.

If user applies currency filter as 'AUD', search is done only within the first 500 records will be displayed - here no AUD cashflow is displayed.

![AUD1.JPG](attachments/AUD1.JPG)

Whereas if custom filter is used to fetch 'AUD' cashflows, system displays all AUD cashflows within the total population of 90050 cashflows.

## *Exceptions Handling

**ANCHOR: Multi Exception**
*

- The Cashflow will be NSTP based on the exceptions setup. If there are no exceptions found, it will be STP.
- The exceptions are setup in line with business workflow. Exceptions and expected actions captured under confluence page: <u>[NSTP Workflow - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence (standardchartered.com)](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/NSTP+Workflow)</u>
- So when there's new cashflow received in Ratan, it would be published to the settlement workflow and run through the exception types and decide if we need to tag this exception to the cashflow.
- Exceptions are triggered based on backend configuration (example: Missing Vostro) or the NSTP rule setup (example: WHT Client)
- Sub state type is Pending Another Leg - followup for fixing / check if there is only one leg for the value date

### Exception Type

<u>Actions permitted on Cashflows (depending upon Cashflow status)</u>

Pending Affirmation Exception

**EXPAND: Pending Confirmation/Affirmation**

1. This exception will be generated if both parent trade affirmation/confirmation and cashflow affirmation are missing for the cashflow. To resolve the exception, either the trade must be matched or the cashflow must be manually marked as affirmed
2. To identify the confirmation status, **refer only to Trade Status field**. Do not refer to Confirmation Status as it will display confirmation internal statuses like PAIRED, PROPOSED etc 1. For Murex trade, status in Matched,PairedDiscrepHost,PairedDiscrepCounterparty,PairedAutomatically,PairedManually,PairedPaper,PairedPhone would be considered as confirmed and not generate the exception. 2. For FMRP trade, status in Matched|Full Affirm,Matched|Completed,Matched|Complete are considered as matched and not generate exception.

![image2024-8-8_13-47-13.png](attachments/image2024-8-8_13-47-13.png)

c.  Trade Status field will show in an unmatched status if the Trade state is in an Unconfirmed state (example: SENT / TOBESENT)

![image2024-8-8_13-50-19.png](attachments/image2024-8-8_13-50-19.png)

1. For cashflow status: 1. Affirmed: Not generate exception 2. Unaffirmed: Generate exception 3. Other: Generate exception
2. If the cashflow affirmation comes after trade confirmation match, no exception will be generated.
3. If cashflow is unaffirmed before trade confirmation match, exception will be generated. Once trade affirmed/confirmed later, exception will be removed automatically.
4. The 'Cashflow Affirmation' is fixed section in Maker's page. Only be editable when there's 'Pending Affirmation' exception.

To perform cashflow affirmation, double click on the cashflow to bring up the cashfow detail page and update the affirmation details as agreed with the counterparty

Vostro/Nostro Related Exception

**EXPAND: Vostro/Nostro Related Exception**

For Missing Vostro/Multi Vostro/Nostro vs Vostro Mismatch/Missing Nostro/adhoc SI exceptions, steps are as below:

a. Maker fill in/verify Vostro & Nostro form

To resolve the exeption, get the SSI setup in SSI+. If urgent, user can key in the SSI manually in the cashflow detail page. The checker must also key in the SSI details (Dual Blind input).

Checker should input the SSI based on the original source of the SSI from client, and not based on Maker's input.

Dual Blind Input is introduced as a key control to prevent Checker errors, hence Checker should not obtain the SSI info from Maker as screenshot or via chat

- - - Users must key in CAPITAL LETTERS - Special characters are not allowed (will be auto removed from SSI / SCI data - When exception is in pending operator status, Maker can select suggested Vostro from the available list, or use adhoc SSI. - Vostro can be manually keyed in if there are no Vostrso available. Nostro can only be selected (no key in option) - Validation between Vostro & Nostro required, settlement means & settlement account must be same. - If Settlement account & Settlement means are different between Vostro & Nostro, system will throw an error to the user. This exception generally generated during auto SSI Stamping. When querying Nostro and there is no unique Nostro, system will select primary Nostro, whose settlement means & settlement account may different with Vostro. It may also happen if user missing to select the right Nostro / made an error while selecting / keying in the Vostro details. - If an SSI has already been stamped and need to key in a new SSI, use 'Reset' button to clear the page and then key in the new SSI to avoid errors - If both Vostro and Nostro are missing, only 'Missing Vostro' will be triggered

![Missing Vostro.JPG](attachments/Missing Vostro.JPG)

![image2023-9-22_10-41-14.png](attachments/image2023-9-22_10-41-14.png)

Mandatory fields are highlighted in red.  When user selects message type as MT202 or MT103, some of information will be auto populated.

Note: For CHINA Day1, the country will be populated with the code (example: CN) and user must manually change it to Country Name (example: CHINA)

MT103:

![auto Capture.JPG](attachments/auto Capture.JPG)

<u>MT202:</u>

<u>![202Capture.JPG](attachments/202Capture.JPG)</u>

b. Checker fill in same Vostro & Nostro with Maker

When exception is in pending verification status, Checker can also select suggested Vostro from the available list, or use adhoc SSI.

Validation between Vostro & Nostro required, settlement means & settlement account must be same.

![image2023-9-22_10-50-53.png](attachments/image2023-9-22_10-50-53.png)

If Maker and Checker filled in the same Vostro & Nostro, exception will be resolved.

If Maker and Checker filled in different Vostro & Nostro, there is reminder for different value.

![image2023-9-22_11-7-41.png](attachments/image2023-9-22_11-7-41.png)

c. Checker Reject SSI

If Maker has put in the incorrect SSI, Checker can reject SSI, so the exception will be back to 'Pending Operator' status and Maker can re-fill in the SSI as step a.

### Amendment / Cancellation

For scenarios where amendment happens after payment is released, user to ensure there is no duplicate payment.

1. Amendment before Payment Release - System will automatically replace the latest cashflow details
2. Cancel before Payment Release - System will automatically move the cashflow to cancelled status
3. Amendment / Cancel on Cashflow which was netted, but before net resultant cashflow is released - system will automatically cancel the net resultant cashflow and update the amended details
4. Cancel on Cashflow which was netted, but before net resultant cashflow is released - system will automatically cancel the net resultant cashflow and update the amended details
5. Amendment after Payment Release - System will generate a withdrawal (reversal will be shown on blotter and exception) and a new cashflow (rebook will be shown on blotter and exception).
6. Cancel after Payment Release - System will generate a withdrawal (reversal will be shown on blotter and exception), which must be released to cancel the original payment.
7. Amendment on Cashflow which was netted, but after net resultant cashflow is released - system will automatically generate a withdrawal and new for the underlying cashflow that was amended. We need to send additional payment or ask client to repay us the excess based on the scenario. Cancellation for the underlying cashflow should not be released as original payment would have been released for Net amount. Users to determine whether to net the reversal and new (or) initiate recall first.
8. Cancel on Cashflow which was netted, but after net resultant cashflow is released - system will automatically cancel the net resultant cashflow and update the amended details- system will automatically generate a withdrawal of the underlying cashflow that was cancelled. We need to send additional payment or ask client to repay us the excess based on the scenario. Cancellation for the underlying cashflow should not be released as original payment would have been released for Net amount.

In the Cashflow Blotter last column 'Event Reason' the indicator of whether it is a 'Reversal' or 'Rebook' will be shown.

This is an important field to monitor to ensure there is no duplicate payment

![Reverse Rebook.JPG](attachments/Reverse Rebook.JPG)

If a cashflow has either 'reversal' or 'rebook' and then it was netted, the net resultant cashflow will contain "reversal_rebook" exception

### Bulk Processing for cashflow

- Details can be found in <u>[Bulk Process for Multi Exceptions - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence (standardchartered.com)](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/Bulk+Process+for+Multi+Exceptions)</u>
- Bulk processing is available on right click of batch cashflow, which have same counterparty/booking entity/value date.
- Bulk Approve/Submit will only appear when cashflow sub state are all in Pending Operator/Pending Verification.

![image2024-6-26_9-47-45.png](attachments/image2024-6-26_9-47-45.png)

- In the bulk process window, cashflow will be separated as eligible for bulk processing or not eligible, based on whether is there non-eligible exception in the cashflow.

![image2024-6-26_9-54-10.png](attachments/image2024-6-26_9-54-10.png)

### Multi Exception Query

- When user try to get cashflow exceptions in cashflow blotter, field NSTP Exception can be used.

![image2024-10-8_15-5-22.png](attachments/image2024-10-8_15-5-22.png)

- When user try to search cashflow by exceptions, NSTP Exception in horizontal search will select all cashflows which contains the exception value.

![image2024-10-8_15-9-22.png](attachments/image2024-10-8_15-9-22.png)

- Exceptions which were processed by maker/checker can be found in cashflow history.

## * TPP (Third Party Payment)*

*On the SI input screen, there is a TPP checkbox. If an TPP SSI is flown from SSI+, the checkbox will automatically be ticked.*

*If SI is being manually input, it must be ticked by the settlement user.*

*TPP Cashflow information is sent to FMMIS and consolidated into a TPP report across systems for payment pattern analysis done by FCSO team (Financial Crime Surveillance)*

## *Grouping Blotter*

Grouping Blotter is showing the payments consumed from upstream like Murex and Stella. Mainly it is guaranteeing the payment to be processed in sequence and determine the non-eco amendment processing.

Payments will only be moved to settlement queue (Cashflow Blotter) when the full set of payment under same trade events arrived.

PENDING status will be shown if there are payment not arrived in same batch, normally it is temporary status and will be auto completed soon. On edge case that some payments not arrive, OPS need to manual STP by confirming with Murex on the payment will never arrive:

![image2024-11-27_11-33-37.png](attachments/image2024-11-27_11-33-37.png)

### * User Manual Deliver*

*OPS is able to manually force deliver cashflow from group blotter directly, once any cashflow has been manual STPed, all other cashflows that from the same group will have to be manual STPed as well*

*![image-2026-4-29_11-28-7.png](attachments/image-2026-4-29_11-28-7.png)*

### *Payment cancelled before publish from Murex*

*Below is a sample happened on production, 104727547 need to be manual STP as the other 2 payments won't be published from Murex since they have been cancelled before publishing. *

**Problem Statement: **

102830762,102830763, 104727547 value on 7-May, Ratan expect to receive all of them, but didn’t receive 102830762,102830763. There is No missing or duplicate settlement issue, but make ops confused and additional manual intervention is required on investigation.

**Root Cause:**

104727547 was generated on 28-Apr, which VD is in future 9 calendar days, so it was real-time published to RATAN,

102830762,102830763 were generated on 03-Mar, by when the VD more than 9 calendar days , so it was not real-time published but wait for batch job publish it on 28-Apr, however these payments was cancelled  before 28-Apr, so these payment didn’t publish to Ratan.

[Grouping Blotter Monitoring - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence (standardchartered.com)](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/Grouping+Blotter+Monitoring)

## *Hold/Unhold/Send to WAITING Cashflow*

When the cashflow does not reach cashflow "cutoff day" yet and in any status (excludes RELEASED, NET or SPLIT) , user can have the option to put the cashflow on hold due to any reason (e.g. user finds some issue or wants to supplement the cashflow/trade info later)

### Maker to Hold a cashflow:

1. First user as a action Maker, go the "Cashflow Blotter", find the target cashflow which Cashflow is in any status (excludes RELEASED, NET or SPLIT)

2. Right click the cashflow, select and click 'Hold' from the action list.  Input Hold comment, click "Submit" button.

![image2023-9-25_16-26-13.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-26-13.png)

![image2023-9-25_16-47-58.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-47-58.png)

3.1 After Hold action summited successfully by maker, the cashflow will be updated to Cashflow State "HOLD", Cashflow Sub State "Pending Verification" and Cashflow Sub State Type "NA"

![image2023-9-25_16-28-8.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-28-8.png)

![image2023-9-25_16-29-26.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-29-26.png)

3.2 When Cashflow State is in "HOLD", user has limited manual actions allowed on Ratan.

Before Hold:

![image2023-9-25_16-49-30.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-49-30.png)

After Hold: When cashflow is in 'HOLD' status, Unhold and Send to waiting action is allowed

![image-2025-10-16_11-5-44.png](attachments/image-2025-10-16_11-5-44.png)

Note: To bulk hold, please tick all targeted cashflows first, then right click one of these cashflows, select and click 'Hold' from the action list.

![image2023-9-26_10-55-50.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_10-55-50.png)

### Checker to Unhold a cashflow:

Only Checker is allowed to do Unhold action. Same user who put a cashflow on Hold cannot perform Unhold  (Same user id can't do the hold & unhold on the same cashflow)

1. The second user as a Checker, go the "Cashflow Blotter", find the above HOLD cashflow which  is in any Cashflow State "HOLD"

2. Right click the cashflow, select and click 'Unhold' from the action list. Input Unhold comment, click "Submit" button.

![image2023-9-25_16-31-30.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-31-30.png)

![image-2025-10-16_11-9-13.png](attachments/image-2025-10-16_11-9-13.png)

3.1 After 'Unhold' action successfully submitted, the Cashflow State, Cashflow Sub State and Cashflow Sub State Type will revert to previous status before 'Hold"

![image2023-9-25_16-39-34.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-39-34.png)

3.2 After ‘Unhold’ successfully and cashflow status reverts back to previous status before 'Hold", user can continue to process from this 'previous' status again.

![image2023-9-25_16-43-30.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_16-43-30.png)

Note: To bulk uhold multiple cashflows, please tick all targeted cashflows first, then right click one of these cashflows, select and click 'Unhold' from the action list.

![image-2025-10-16_11-9-59.png](attachments/image-2025-10-16_11-9-59.png)

### Send to WAITING

After cashflow moved to HOLD status, user can select "Send to WAITING" action from right-click menu

![image-2025-10-16_11-35-17.png](attachments/image-2025-10-16_11-35-17.png)

after send to waiting submitted, cashflow will be moved to WAITING status with "Reinstate" exception.

## *Auto / Manually Net/Un-Net Cashflow*

*Cashflows can be netted automatically by the system or manually by user based on the scenario*

| **Scenarios** | **Operator** | **Affirm during netting** | **Pending Affirmation Exception** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bilateral Netting | Manually done by user | User manually key in affirmation info when submit netting | No |
| CCIL Netting | Manually done by user | User manually key in affirmation info when submit netting | No |
| Ben BIC Netting | Manually done by user | NA | Yes |
| NDS Auto Netting | Auto done by system | NA | Yes |
| IRS Fix leg & Floating Leg merge( same trade id, vd) | Auto done by system | NA | Yes |
| Auto Netting | Auto done by system | Affirm by system | No |

### *Adhoc/Manually Net Cashflow

**ANCHOR: Adhoc Netting**
*

In Ratan, user can net the trades if their Currency (CCY), Counterparty, Booking Entity (FMID / FMCODE), Payment Date are the same.

1. Login to Ratan. Go to Cashflow Blotter, find and select the targeted 2 or more cashflows which are in Queued/Projected/Waiting status and with same Currency (CCY), Counterparty, Booking Entity (FMID / FMCODE), and Payment Date. Right click on one of these cashflows, click "Net Selected Cashflow" from the action list.

* **Note**: if cashflow is in 'READY' status,

- cashflow sub state type is "NA", user can do net or un-net.
- cashflow sub state type is "Pending ACK", user can't do the net or un-net.
- less than 10 mins before release cut off, user cannot perform net in READY status. Ops users can move the cashflow back to WAITING by using *Hold > Send to WAITING* action, allowing netting to continue

![image2023-9-26_15-10-43.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_15-10-43.png)

2. Have a double check on the cashflow netting preview for the netting result cashflow and the 2 or more netting component cashflows key information. If no further concern, click "Net All Cashflow With Affirmation", input your name and contact info, then click "Submit".

![image2023-9-26_15-44-58.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_15-44-58.png)

![image2023-9-26_15-48-29.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_15-48-29.png)

3.1 After "Net All Cashflow With Affirmation" submitted successfully, on the Cashflow Netting Preview window, you can see for the netting result cashflow which is the Result of netted the cashflows, a new cashflow ID will be generated and in cashflow status "QUEUED"; and the status of the component cashflow will be moved to "NETTED".

![image2023-9-26_15-58-20.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_15-58-20.png)

3.2 "Adhoc_Netting" will be showed under the Multi Exception list

![image2023-9-26_16-32-2.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_16-32-2.png)

And you can click "Display Component Cashflow" to check the netted component cashflows which resulted this cashflow after netting.

![image2023-9-26_16-43-0.png](attachments/image2023-9-26_16-43-0.png)

### *Unnet Cashflow*

User can manually unnet a netted resultant cashflow.

1. Login Ratan, go to New Tile → Cashflow Blotter. Find the targeted netted result cashflow which is in Queued/Projected/Waiting status, right click on this cashflow and click on "Un-Net Cashflow" from the action list.

* Note: For 'READY' status, if the cashflow is in 'READY' status and release (from Ratan to Razor) cutoff time is not approaching yet, then user can do net or un-net. If cashflow in 'READY' but sub status == Pending ACK, then user can't do the net or un-net.

![image2023-9-27_15-36-41.png](attachments/image2023-9-27_15-36-41.png)

2. Preview the component cashflows after unnet. If no concern, click "Un-Net All Cashflow" button to complete the unnet action.

![image2023-9-27_15-42-37.png](attachments/image2023-9-27_15-42-37.png)

3. Once "Un-Net All Cashflow" successfully, the netting result cashflow's state will move to DEAD.

![image2023-9-27_15-45-52.png](attachments/image2023-9-27_15-45-52.png)

![image2023-9-27_15-46-55.png](attachments/image2023-9-27_15-46-55.png)

And the netting component cashflows' state will move to QUEUED → WAITING.

![image2023-9-27_16-3-15.png](attachments/image2023-9-27_16-3-15.png)

![image2023-9-27_16-4-36.png](attachments/image2023-9-27_16-4-36.png)

* Note:

If any of the netted component cashflows get amended after netting, all the netted component cashflows would auto get unnetted and move to Gross, the netting result cashflow's state would move to DEAD. So the user would have to manually re-net these amended component cashflows accordingly by following above adhoc/manually net cashflow process if netting these cashflows is still desired.

### *Net Cashflows with Past Value Date*

User would be able to net the past value cashflows.

When the cashflows are in Failed status, having NSTP rule and the value date (payment date) is past already, user would have to Reinstate the cashflows first and then manually Net them if netting is requested.

1. Login to Ratan. Go to Cashflow Blotter, find and select 2 or more targeted cashflows which are all in FAILED status, having NSTP rules (by filter isSTP=No) and with same Currency (CCY), Counterparty, Booking Entity (FMID / FMCODE), and Payment Date (the date is already past). Right click on one of these cashflows, click "Reinstate" from the action list.

![image2023-9-28_10-27-47.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-27-47.png)

![image2023-9-28_9-51-30.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_9-51-30.png)

2. After Reinstate, the cashflows state will update from FAILED → QUEUED → WAITING

![image2023-9-28_10-29-47.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-29-47.png)

3. Select and tick these targeted cashflows again, Right click on one of these cashflows, click "Net Selected Cashflow" from the action list.

![image2023-9-28_10-33-40.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-33-40.png)

4. Have a double check on the cashflow netting preview for the netting result cashflow and the 2 or more netting component cashflows key information. If no further concern, click "Net All Cashflow With Affirmation", input your name and contact info, then click "Submit".

![image2023-9-28_10-36-8.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-36-8.png)

![image2023-9-28_10-37-33.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-37-33.png)

5. After "Net All Cashflow With Affirmation" submitted successfully, on the Cashflow Netting Preview window, you can see for the netting result cashflow which is the Result of netted the cashflows, a new cashflow ID will be generated and in cashflow status "QUEUED" → "WAITING"; and for the component cashflow, its state will be moved to "NETTED".

![image2023-9-28_10-38-16.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-38-16.png)

5.2 And in the cashflow detail page of the netting result cashflow, you can click "Display Component Cashflow" to check its netted component cashflows's info.

![image2023-9-28_10-43-43.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-43-43.png)

![image2023-9-28_10-44-9.png](attachments/image2023-9-28_10-44-9.png)

### *Settle As Gross **

**ANCHOR: Settle as Gross**
*

When the cashflow is in 'Pending Netting' or 'Pending Another Leg', users can have action option to "Settle as Gross" to manually settle this cashflow as Gross.

Important: This has a impact on Client limits, so we should move a cashflow from 'Pending Netting' or 'DVP' to 'Gross' only if there is an approval from TRM team specifically.

1. First user as a action Maker, Go the "Cashflow Blotter", find the target cashflow which Cashflow State is in "wanting" and Cashflow Sub State Type is in "pending another leg"

2. Right click the cashflow, select 'Settle as Gross' from the action list.

![image2023-9-21_14-56-16.png](attachments/image2023-9-21_14-56-16.png)

3. Then the cashflow is updated to Cashflow Sub State "Pending Verification" (make sure maker has completed to affirm all items under multi exception list which are pending operator), Sub State Type "Pending Exception" , Cashflow Affirmation Status "Affirmed", and then a new exception item "Settle as Gross" will appear under multi exception list.

![image2023-9-25_10-19-17.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_10-19-17.png)![image2023-9-25_10-14-13.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_10-14-13.png)

4.  Second user as a Checker, go to this cashflow detail page in cashflow blotter. Find the "Settle as Gross" in the multiple exception list. Click "Approve" button to approve this "Settle As Gross" action from maker.

![image2023-9-25_10-36-50.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_10-36-50.png)

![image2023-9-25_10-36-16.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_10-36-16.png)

5.1 After checker approves the action, the cashflow status will update to "Ready"

![image2023-9-25_10-39-22.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_10-39-22.png)

5.2 But if Checker rejects the action from the multi exception list, then the Cashflow Sub State will update to "Pending Operator" and the "Settle to Gross" will be changed to "Adhoc SSI" under multi exception list.

Checker will have to select the reason for rejection and comments is mandatory. If only SSI is incorrect, Checker should select SSI while rejecting.

![image2023-11-16_14-49-7.png](attachments/image2023-11-16_14-49-7.png)

![image2023-9-25_14-54-37.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_14-54-37.png)

![image2023-9-25_14-51-9.png](attachments/image2023-9-25_14-51-9.png)

### *CCIL Netting*

- Ratan identify the Guaranteed (booked with counterparty as Clearing Corporation of India - CCIL/MMB) & Non Guaranteed (booked with specific counterparties maintained in Ratan as a backend static). Cashflows will be stamped with settlement method == 'CCIL', based on below logic:

1. 1. Entity.Booking_Entity_SCI_FMID == '4' 2. Instrument_Common.Murex_Product_Family=='IRD' and Instrument_Common.Murex_Product_Group=='IRS' 3. Entity.Counterparty_SCI_FMID is 400021949 or the FMID from the non guaranteed CCIL client static data list 4. Cashflow.Payment_Currency is INO

- Guaranteed: If Cashflow sub State Type == 'Pending Netting' and Settlement Method == 'CCIL' and counterparty FMID =='400021949'
- Non-Guaranteed: If Settlement_Method == 'CCIL' and Cashflow.Cashflow_Sub_State_Type == 'Pending Netting' and counterparty FMID !='400021949'
- Net resultant from guaranteed and non-guaranteed cannot be netted together.
- Details can be found in <u>[CCIL Netting - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence (standardchartered.com)](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/CCIL+Netting)</u>

### *NDS Fixing Netting*

- For Murex non-deliverable cashflow, it will be Auto Netted in RATAN based on NID, except for ND IRS.
- Ratan will query parent trade typology (trade in the same NID) from TDS3 once metalized.
- If cashflow satisfies NSTP rule, Typology in(NDS, NDS Fixing, NDCF, NDFRA, ND CDS Fixing, ND CDS and ND-Convert) and ND_Parent_typology != NDIRS and cashflow event not in (reversal, rebook), then cashflow will be in WAITING + Pending Exception status.
- **No manual touch on the NSTP rule** (Pending NDS Netting), which may impact the auto netting.
- Ratan will scan all cashflows every 30 mins, if it satisfies below condition, cashflow will be auto netted.

a. Cashflow value date is in [Today, Today+2 business day]

b. Same Booking Entity, Counterparty, same VD, CCY, NID

c. Status = WAITING + Pending Exception

d. Pending Exception contains 'Pending NDS Netting'

### *Beneficiary BIC Netting*

- For Murex payment, if it satisfies Beneficiary BIC static, it will be marked as Beneficiary BIC flag =Y and in WAITING + Pending Netting status.
- ![image2024-11-25_13-53-59.png](attachments/image2024-11-25_13-53-59.png)
- ![image2024-11-27_10-13-26.png](attachments/image2024-11-27_10-13-26.png)
- Control build to reduce operation risk, as it only allow cashflow on Same BIC_Net Flag (Y) + Same Beneficiary BIC + Same Value Date + Same Entity, can be performed as BIC Netting.
- For Ben BIC netting eligible cashflow, operation team can manually Settle As Gross if necessary.
- If any amendment or withdrawal on Ben BIC component cashflow, netting resultant cashflow will be auto un-netted if it's not released yet.
- There are segregation between Ben BIC Netting and CCIL Netting/Bilateral Netting
- Affirmation details need to be filled in when validating netting resultant cashflow.
- If any static update, it will take effect immediately. For already materialized cashflow, updated static can take effect after fail and reinstate.

### *Auto Netting*

#### * Auto Netting Static*

![image-2025-7-31_20-32-53.png](attachments/image-2025-7-31_20-32-53.png)

- *FMO Ops can request Data Ops team to create auto netting rule or switch existing manual netting rule to auto netting rule with below properties added:* - **Netting Date Time**: define the time when system start to perform netting - **STP Level**: define the STP level for netting resultant cashflow - NSTP_MAKER_CHECKER - NSTP_CHECKER_ONLY - **Netting Type: **different netting type will have different result, please make sure this is set correctly

![image-2025-7-31_21-1-45.png](attachments/image-2025-7-31_21-1-45.png)

- Auto netting rule creation/update/disable will trigger cashflow refresh - if data ops **create new auto netting rule,** system will check all cashflow in below status and filter a list of cashflow need to be refreshed - **Refresh **Netting id ='' or Netting id is null** **and Cashflow_Status = WAITING (Pending Netting, Pending Exception) or Cashflow_Status = READY (cashflow state type is null) and meet the rule condition - **NOT** refresh cashflow in WAITING (Pending Another leg, Pending Auto netting) READY (Pending Ack), HOLD, SUPPRESSED, NETTED, RELEASED, SETTLED - if data ops **disable existing auto netting rule, **system will refresh below cashflow - **Refresh** Cashflow_Status = WAITING (Pending Auto Netting) and tagged to the disabled rule - **NOT** refresh cashflow in WAITING (Pending Another leg, Pending Netting, Pending Exception), READY, HOLD, SUPPRESSED, NETTED, RELEASED, SETTLED - if data ops **update existing rule**, - Update existing auto netting rule without rule type change - **Refresh **Cashflow_Status = WAITING (Pending Auto Netting) and tagged to the updated rule - **Refresh **Netting id ='' or Netting id is null** **and Cashflow_Status = WAITING (Pending Netting, Pending Exception) or Cashflow_Status = READY (cashflow state type is null) and meet the rule condition - **NOT** refresh cashflow in WAITING (Pending Another leg, Pending Auto netting) READY (Pending Ack), HOLD, SUPPRESSED, NETTED, RELEASED, SETTLED - Update manual netting rule to auto netting rule - **Refresh **Netting id ='' or Netting id is null** **and Cashflow_Status = WAITING (Pending Netting, Pending Exception) or Cashflow_Status = READY (cashflow state type is null) and meet the rule condition - **NOT** refresh cashflow in WAITING (Pending Another leg, Pending Auto netting) READY (Pending Ack), HOLD, SUPPRESSED, NETTED, RELEASED, SETTLED - Update auto netting rule to manual netting rule - **Refresh** Cashflow_Status = WAITING (Pending Auto Netting) and tagged to the rule - **NOT** refresh cashflow in WAITING (Pending Another leg, Pending Netting, Pending Exception), READY, HOLD, SUPPRESSED, NETTED, RELEASED, SETTLED

#### Auto Netting Process

- If cashflow hit the rule defined in the auto netting static, it will be hold in "Pending Auto Netting" status
- There will be scheduled job runs every 30 minutes to check if the pending auto netting cashflow past or equal to the configured netting date time. - if yes, system net the cashflow with defined netting type, the netting resultant cashflow is affirmed by system - if no, keep the cashflow in pending auto netting to wait for next job
- Netting resultant cashflow will be auto affirmed by system and there will <u>**not **</u>be "pending affirmation" exception
- Netting resultant will be hold in NSTP with "Auto Netting" exception requires approval level defined in the netting static (maker_checker, checker_only or full_stp)
- if one cashflow hit multiple rules , system will tag the rule with highest priority netting type and latest created rule to the cashflow. - Netting type priority: SAL MTM Netting > SAL Coupon Netting >Clearing_Swift_Suppress > CCIL Netting > BIC Netting >Bilateral Netting - For example: - if cashflow hit SAL MTM netting rule and another Bilateral Netting rule, system will tag SAL MTM netting rule to the cashflow - if cashflow hit 2 bilateral netting rule, system will tag the latest created rule to the cashflow
- if the netting resultant is not expected, user can manually unnet the cashflow, the component cashflow will be in pending auto netting status and being netted by system when scheduled job triggers
- if user found anything wrong with the netting static, please update the rule before un-net the netting resultant cashflow.

### *Inter entity Netting*

- Scope - ![image-2026-6-8_10-38-30.png](attachments/image-2026-6-8_10-38-30.png) - Inter entity netting to be done on gross cashflow for SCB inter entities (including IRS aggregation resultant) - initial scope: cashflows between SCB CHO and SCB HK - Currency: USD for day1. Additional currencies can be added later. (CIS involvement required if PM ccy is needed). - *Amount <=USD 100K * - *Cashflow event is NEW* - *Cashflow with Rebook, Reversal, Reversal_Rebook event reason is excluded.* - *LOANIQ cashflow is excluded.*
- *Cashflow match the netting rule condition will be moved to "pending auto netting" status, system will perform below match validation when configured netting date time reached.* - CCY, VD. amount should be the same between C1 C2 - Direction of C1 C2 should be opposite - C1 booking entity fmid = C2 counterparty mapped value - C2 booking entity fmid = C1 counterparty mapped value - by default, mapped value will be the the FMID - if there is any special value instead of FMID to be used for any counterparty, need to add the record to backend static (release required), sample as below - ![image-2026-6-4_11-44-37.png](attachments/image-2026-6-4_11-44-37.png)
- if cashflow find matched pair, both cashflow will be eligible for auto netting, system will net them with affirmation. - the ones not matched will be sent as gross without affirmation - the ones matched but there is no other cashflow to net with, will also be sent as gross without affirmation
- new netting type "Inter Entity Netting" need to be selected in the auto netting rule. below backend configuration is linked to the type: - netting key will be： booking entity FMID + VD + Currency + Counterparty mapped value - netting resultant counterparty fmid/bic code will randomly derive from one component cashflow - netting resultant payment type = 'Inter Entity Netting'
- Amendment/Withdrawal happened after netting resultant generated - if both side netting resultant not released from Ratan, system will trigger auto unnet once withdrawal received - if one side netting resultant released from Ratan, system will **not **trigger auto unnet for both side - Withdrawal/new event for the released side will have reversal/rebook exception - Withdrawal/new event for the not released side will not have reversal/rebook exception - User need to release the other side netting resultant since one side have been released - if both side netting resultant released from Ratan, system will not trigger auto unnet for both side
- Manual unnet after netting resultant generated - if manual unnet required, ops should manual unnet netting resultant from both side, component cashflow will be moved back to pending auto netting status and matched cashflow will be netted in 30 minutes - if ops manual unnet only one side, component cashflow will be moved back to pending auto netting, and will be send as gross because of no matched cashflow from other side.

## *Cashflow Suppression*

There are 2 ways to suppress the cashflows In Ratan: Auto cashflow suppression and manual cashflow suppression.

*Auto Cashflow Suppression
**ANCHOR: Suppression**
*

The Suppression rules blotter is where the user can predefine and create the rule for auto suppression of cashflow.

RATAN will not send suppressed cashflows to RAZOR, so no payment or settlement accounting entries will be generated. So this table should be used only for scenarios where no payment or accounting is expected.

In Ratan, this requires a 4 eye checking to approve the suppression, Suppression can be done for individual cashflows or can be made for a particular group.

1. Maker to go to Suppression Rules blotter, the user should click on New Tile -> Suppression Rules [Cashflow]. where you can view the suppression rules which are already created and also can create new rules which will need a 4 eye check and approval

![image2023-10-6_10-52-38.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_10-52-38.png)

2. To add a new rule for cashflow suppression, click "Add Rule" button.

![image2023-10-6_10-54-29.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_10-54-29.png)

3. Input below required rule information then click "Add" button to submit.

- Please Choose Rules Item: There are multiple criteria's from which the user will be able to suppress a cashflow. e.g. if the user wants to suppress all the cashflows for an internal counterparty(DDINT), the user can click on Please Choose Rules Item -> Counterparty and input the Counterparty FMID.
- Reason: free text box for you to input the suppression remarks or reasons.

![image2023-10-6_11-21-43.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_11-21-43.png)

4. Click on Yes to continue. Then the rule will go for validation like a 4 eye check, so you will see the next 'Action' needed is to "Verify" this rule.

![image2023-10-5_14-14-10.png](attachments/image2023-10-5_14-14-10.png)

![image2023-10-6_10-41-16.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_10-41-16.png)

5. Another User as checker who has the rule validation access (not the same user who has created) can logon Ratan and go to New Tile -> Suppression Rules [Cashflow], sort rules according to the Date, find this NSTP rule created just now. Click "Verify" button.

![image2023-10-6_10-55-33.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_10-55-33.png)

6. If this Validator is satisfied with the Suppression rule, Click "Create Rule" button. If this not satisfied with the Suppression rule, Click "Delete Rule" button.

![image2023-10-6_11-0-18.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_11-0-18.png)

7. After this suppression rule is verified, the "Verify" button will disappear and a bin icon will appear under Action.

So once any cashflow is unaffirmed and hits this cashflow suppression rule, it will be suppressed automatically by the system.

![image2023-10-6_11-2-8.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_11-2-8.png)

*Manual Cashflow Suppression*

In Ratan, user can manually suppress the cashflows directly from the cashflow blotter.

RATAN will not send suppressed cashflows to RAZOR, so no payment or settlement accounting entries will be generated. It is not advisable to manually suppress cashflows for this reason, unless no payment settlement and no accounting are required.

1. Maker can go to New Tile -> Cashflow Blotter,

![image2023-10-6_11-31-6.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_11-31-6.png)

2. Select one or multiple cashflow(s) which are in PROJECTED/QUEUED/READY(only when Sub State Type is "NA")/WAITING state, right click on the cashflow, select and click "Suppress Cashflow".

![image2023-10-6_16-11-52.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_16-11-52.png)

3. Once the system prompts below window, input the cashflow suppression comment and click Submit to finish.

![image2023-10-6_15-40-11.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_15-40-11.png)

4. After Maker submit the cashflow suppression, the Cashflow Sub State will update to "Pending Verification" and Cashflow Sub State Type to be "Cashflow Suppression".

![image2023-10-6_17-19-34.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_17-19-34.png)

5. And then this Cashflow goes for a 4 eye check. Another user as checker who has suppression approval permission needs to login Ratan and goes to Cashflow Blotter, find this cashflow, select and click "Confirm Suppression".

![image2023-10-6_17-20-35.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_17-20-35.png)

6. Input your comment and then click "Approve"/Reject" to finish

![image2023-10-6_17-21-25.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_17-21-25.png)

5. Once the suppression is approved, then the Cashflow State will update from "Waiting" to "Cashflow_Suppressed" and Cashflow Sub State &Type to be "NA".

![image2023-10-6_17-22-22.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_17-22-22.png)

![image2023-10-6_17-33-25.png](attachments/image2023-10-6_17-33-25.png)

*Manual Cashflow Un-suppression*

In Ratan, the user will be able to un-suppress the cashflows which are already suppressed, in case the previous suppression was done in error.

1. First user as a Maker, Go to Cashflow Blotter, Search for the suppressed cashflow which cashflow state is "CASHFLOW_SUPPRESSED", Right click on this cashflow, select and click the "Un-Suppress Cashflow" from the available action option list.

![image2023-10-9_14-6-41.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-6-41.png)

2. Input comment for un-suppression, click on Submit to confirm the un-suppression.

![image2023-10-9_14-10-34.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-10-34.png)

3. Once Maker submits the un-suppression, the Cashflow State will change to "WAITING", Cashflow Sub Sate change to "Pending Verification", Cashflow Sub State Type to "Undo Cashflow Suppression" and Cashflow Affirmation to "Unaffirmed".

![image2023-10-9_14-12-52.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-12-52.png)

![image2023-10-9_14-17-46.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-17-46.png)

4. Another user as Checker go to Cashflow Blotter, Search for this trying-to-un-suppressed cashflow which Cashflow Sub State is "Pending Verification" and Cashflow Sub State Type is "Undo Cashflow Suppression". Right click on this cashflow, select and click the "Confirm Un-Suppression" from the available action option list.

![image2023-10-9_14-21-37.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-21-37.png)

5. Input the comment for un-suppression and Click "Approve" button to complete.

![image2023-10-9_14-25-12.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-25-12.png)

6. Once Checker approves the cashflow un-suppression successfully, the Cashflow State will change to from "WAITING" (Cashflow Sub State "Pending Verification" and Cashflow Sub State Type "Undo Cashflow Suppression") to "QUEUED" and then to "WAITING" (Sub State "Pending Operator" and Cashflow Sub State Type "Pending Exception").

![image2023-10-9_14-26-16.png](attachments/image2023-10-9_14-26-16.png)

## *Swift Suppression*

For EG / NP / SA / LOANIQ where RAZOR is downstream, RATAN will send not swift suppressed cashflows to RAZOR, no payment and no settlement accounting entries will be generated. So this table is not expected to be used

If payment is to be suppressed, but accounting to be generated, settle the payment to Nostro with 'SUPPRESSXXX' or 'REJECTXXALL' BIC.

For other markets where RATAN is directly generating Accounting, SWIFT Suppression will generate accounting entries as per the Nostro static.

There are 2 ways to suppress the cashflows In Ratan: Auto cashflow suppression and manual cashflow suppression.

*Auto Swift Suppression
**ANCHOR: Swift Suppression**
*

The Suppression rules blotter is where the user can predefine and create the rule for auto swift suppression.

In Ratan, this requires a 4 eye checking to approve the suppression, Suppression can be done for individual cashflows or can be made for a particular group.

1. Maker to go to Suppression Rules blotter, the user should click on New Tile -> Suppression Rules [Swift]. where you can view the suppression rules which are already created and also can create new rules which will need a 4 eye check and approval

## *Lien Monitoring Murex vs RATAN*

Run Lien booked cashflow report via Murex. Steps to retrieve report attached below

1. In Payment > Query Payment Table

![image2024-7-1_13-18-46.png](attachments/image2024-7-1_13-18-46.png)

1. Select Query Payment Table > User Filter > Click Dropdown Button of Filter

![image2024-7-1_13-19-17.png](attachments/image2024-7-1_13-19-17.png)

1. Search FMRP and Enter followed by FMRP Lien

![image2024-7-1_13-20-42.png](attachments/image2024-7-1_13-20-42.png)

1. Once selected click Proceed

![image2024-7-1_13-21-4.png](attachments/image2024-7-1_13-21-4.png)

**Lien Exception in Ratan**

When LIEN is placed & Lien amount update on a trade, all of its cashflows (including interest) must be NSTP in RATAN with 'LIEN' exception (Maker +  Checker).

In the Murex trade booking model, there're market events to place Lien on the trade level and the Lien information is feeding to TDS3. RATAN is going to source the trade Lien information from TDS3 and use this drive the cashflow NSTP exception.

- '**LIEN on Trade**' exception would be system pre-defined maker/checker exception which ops(business rule and data ops profiles) can't update/remove.
- Exception for Gross Cashflow: RATAN need to lookup the Lien amount from latest event from parent trade(by original trade id), if there's Lien available from trade, then generate '**LIEN on Trade**' exception on cashflow

![image2024-11-27_13-53-14.png](attachments/image2024-11-27_13-53-14.png)

## *RFR and Swap Agent*

Murex Booking Model:

- Generally RFR and Swap Agent are 3 trades booked with same LtiID, to book notional on T day, interest on T+2 day CCS trade. - Trade 1 would have T+2 coupon and T+2 dummy notional - Trade 2 would have T notional - Trade 3 would have T+2 dummy notional to reversal trade 1 dummy notional
- So Trade 1 T+2 coupon and Trade 2 T notional will be sent to RATAN
- Strategy 'RECALC' / 'SWAP_AGENT' used to mark these 3 trades & underlying payments

RATAN Handling:

- Interim MTM & Coupon in Swap Agent can be netted together
- Netting resultant cashflow from Interim MTM & Coupon in Swap Agent would be SWIFT Suppressed in RATAN as it would be settled in clearing house, accounting will generate.
- Initial notional and final notional in Swap Agent would be bilateral settled.
- Notional/coupon/interim MTM from RFR would be bilateral settled in RATAN.

![image2024-11-27_14-36-57.png](attachments/image2024-11-27_14-36-57.png)

Details can be found in [RFR and Swap Agent - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence (standardchartered.com)](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/RFR+and+Swap+Agent)

## Split/Auto Distribution

Details referred to [Cashflow Splitting - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/Cashflow+Splitting)

### Manual Split

- user can split the cashflow if cashflow is in - WAITING - READY (sub state type is "NA") and more than 10 mins before release cut off. - if cashflow is in READY and less than 10 mins before release cut off, ops users can move the cashflow back to WAITING by using *Hold > Send to WAITING* action, allowing splitting to continue

![image-2025-11-20_9-57-41.png](attachments/image-2025-11-20_9-57-41.png)

![image-2025-9-25_23-4-16.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-4-16.png)

- User can lookup SSI for the split child if needed.
- User confirm the split action and input affirmation info, system will move parent cashflow to SPLIT status and child cashflow generated with S prefix.

![image-2025-11-20_10-2-32.png](attachments/image-2025-11-20_10-2-32.png)

![image-2025-9-25_23-7-40.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-7-40.png)

### Un-Split

- if user found issue after the split, they can select the cashflow and perform un-split if cashflow are in eligible status (QUEUED,WAITING,FAILED, HOLD, READY(NA), CASHFLOW_SUPPRESSED) ![image-2025-9-25_23-9-47.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-9-47.png)
- Un-Split Result 1. Parent cashflow moved to WAITING status with Un-Split exception 2. Child cashflow moved to DEAD status 3. Splitting Id removed from the cashflow ![image-2025-9-25_23-13-35.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-13-35.png)

### Amend Split

- ometimes, ops have released some child cashflow but notice the amount is incorrect for the rest, user can amend the amount If at least 2 child cashflow are in WAITING status
- only the amount of WAITING cashflow can be updated
- user need to make sure the total amount of all child cashflow are equal to the original cashflow ![image-2025-9-25_23-20-25.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-20-25.png) ![image-2025-9-25_23-21-22.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-21-22.png)
- Split Amend Result 1. Parent cashflow will not be impacted, still in SPLIT status 2. child cashflow amount updated to the new value and hold in WAITING status with an extra "Split Amend" exception ![image-2025-9-25_23-27-14.png](attachments/image-2025-9-25_23-27-14.png)

### Withdrawal Event Handling

- If child cashflow have not been released from Ratan, withdrawal event will be moved to SPLIT status, child cashflow will be cancelled
- if any child cashflow have been released from Ratan, withdrawal event will be moved to SPLIT status, child cashflow not released will be directly cancelled, child cashflow released will with corresponding withdrawal event hold in NSTP pending user action

### Auto Distribution Process

Some nostro agent may have threshold for the cashflow amount can be processed. If any cashflow exceed the threshold, system will split the cashflow to lower amount at release cut off time and directly generate swift and accounting for each child to downstream.

1. Nostro Threshold Static 1. add a new blotter to manage related static, data ops have access to create/update/delete. Other users only have read only view. 2. currency is mandatory, booking entity, nostro agent bic are optional ![image-2025-9-26_9-46-9.png](attachments/image-2025-9-26_9-46-9.png)
2. if there is any exception happened in the auto split process, move cashflow to Cashflow State = QUEUED, Cashflow Sub Status Type = Pending Exception, user can check the comment from cashflow history - if the exception is caused by unexpected tech reasons, user can reinstate the cashflow to continue the process. - if the exception is caused by nostro threshold set up, user can request static ops to update the value and reinstate the cashflow to use the latest static set up to generate the child. ![image-2026-2-26_17-0-17.png](attachments/image-2026-2-26_17-0-17.png)

## FX Utilization

Reference Page: [FXU - RATAN analysis - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/FXU+-+RATAN+analysis)

For the FX deals which are booked in FM booking system(S2BX, BLADE) tend to make a payment to Transaction Banking Client(Trade Services, Cash Management, or Security Services) account by intervention of CMO/Trade/Securities OPS.

While for EG/NP/SA entity, FX deals will be processed in Ratan side, FXU (Razor) will query the trade/cashflow data from Ratan, then send the utilization request to Ratan.

### Utilization Workflow

For settlement method='UTIL', cashflow will be identified as utilization cashflow. For these cashflow:

- As there is early utilization request for EG/SA/NP, when cashflow comes it would be the directly materialized without waiting for VD-5.
- Util cashflow will skip rule check (including Cashflow_suppression, SWIFT_suppression, Netting, NSTP).
- Util cashflow will only perform Nostro stamping based on static data setup in Ratan for settlement means and settlement account. - If the client setup as auto util client, settlement means and account should be stamped as FXBRREC - If the client setup as manual util client, settlement means and account should be stamped as FXBRREC-M
- If no Nostro stamping exception, cashflow will directly go to READY status and ready for utilization request.
- Once utilization happens, accounting entry will be generated correspondingly.

### Utilization Status

RATAN would have 3 main cashflow status help FMO identify the utilization status

- UTILIZED**, **: Full amount is utilized and remaining amount is 0 - Manual Util: full utilization amount request from FXU - Auto Util: by auto util cutoff, all auto util cashflow will be auto utilized.
- PARTIALLY-UTILIZED: Partial amount is utilized and remaining amount is not 0 - Partial utilization: partial utilization request from FXU - Reversal: partial utilization can be reversed once got the reversal request from FXU
- PASTDUE: No utilization happen until VD EOD (auto) - For manual util, if no utilization request comes from FXU, then post auto util, status will be moved to pastdue.

For UTILIZED/PARTIALLY-UTILIZED cashflow, Ratan will write status back to Stella for hard blocking any further event for the trade.

Detailed status machine can refer to [Status Machine - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/Status+Machine)

### Settlement Method Update

For Gross trades and Util trades, user can switch cashflow settlement method to each other.

The settlement method update has to be on trade level.

- When cashflow status in (PROJECTED, WAITING, READY, PASTDUE) and settlement method in ('', 'GROSS','UTIL') and FX product and data source system !=RATAN and event reason !='reversal', trade will be eligible for settlement method update. - If cashflow status is not in above list, user need to manually process cashflow to make it eligible for processing. - i.e. early materlize for PROJECTED cashflow, unsuppress for CASHFLOW_SUPPRESSED/SWIFT_SUPPRESSED cashflow.
- If user only selected 1 cashflow in cashflow blotter, system will automatically display all cashflows under the same trade.
- For trade contains ERROR cashflow, it would be not eligible for settlement method update request.
- Limitation for bulk update is 100 trade/cashflow.
- During settlement method update, backend code would check utilization static for eligible entity FMIDs as control

### Exception Handling

1. If there is missing nostro/multi nostro exception for util cashflow, FMO needs to add/delete nostro for cashflow processing.
2. If cashflow settlement means is set as FXBRREC/FXBRREC_M, then will not be switched to the other. 1. If the client static is updated, then only newly comes cashflow will have the update settlement means/account
3. If accounting entry got MISS_INFO, then Utilization ops needs to manually handle in Oscar.
4. If cashflow is utilized, but trade is amendment/cancelled, cashflow in Ratan will be in ERROR status and not support for any further action, user needs to manually process accounting entry in Oscar. | | | Trade Id | Product | Cashflow Id | Cashflow Status | Major Version | Payment Type | Currency | Payment Date | Payment Amount | Remaining Amount | Settlement Means | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 7/20/2025 | Trade booking | T01 | Forward | C01 | PROJECTED | 2 | Cashflow | SAR | 8/1/2025 | 800 | 800 | | | | | T01 | Forward | C02 | PROJECTED | 2 | Cashflow | USD | 8/1/2025 | 100 | 100 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 7/25/2025 | Materialization | T01 | Forward | C01 | READY | 2 | Cashflow | SAR | 8/1/2025 | 800 | 800 | FXBRREC | | | | T01 | Forward | C02 | READY | 2 | Cashflow | USD | 8/1/2025 | 100 | 100 | FXBRREC | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 8/1/2025 | Auto Utilization | T01 | Forward | C01 | UTILIZED | 2 | Cashflow | SAR | 8/1/2025 | 800 | 800 | FXBRREC | | | | T01 | Forward | C02 | UTILIZED | 2 | Cashflow | USD | 8/1/2025 | 100 | 100 | FXBRREC | | | Stella failed on hard block | | | | | | | | | | | | | 8/1/2025 | Trade Amendment | T01 | Forward | C01 | ERROR | 2 | Cashflow | SAR | 8/1/2025 | 800 | 800 | FXBRREC | | | | T01 | Forward | C02 | ERROR | 2 | Cashflow | USD | 8/1/2025 | 100 | 100 | FXBRREC | | | | T01 | Forward | C03 | ERROR | 2 | Cashflow | SAR | 8/1/2025 | 700 | 700 | FXBRREC | | | | T01 | Forward | C04 | ERROR | 2 | Cashflow | USD | 8/1/2025 | 100 | 100 | FXBRREC |
5. If accounting entry got NACK from EBBS, ops will manually handle

### Utilization Static

- Utilization Static (Client Static) sample data

| Entity FMID | Entity FMCODE | Counterparty FMID | Counterparty FMCODE | is Auto Util |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 401036553 | SCB EGYPT*CAI | 401039206 | TBFX EGYPT*CAI | Yes |
| 401036553 | SCB EGYPT*CAI | 400818384 | OBATBFX*ACC | Yes |
| 400991880 | SCB SAUDI*RYD | 400992471 | TBFX SAUDI*RYD | Yes |

- Nostro Static - Copied FXBRREC nostro set to FXBRREC-M - For any new utilization currency/nostro onboarding, nostro should be setup for both FXBRREC and FXBRREC-M.

## Last Mile Check

With the increasing business handled by RATAN and the complexity of the business, in order to prevent wrong payment or duplicated payment, we add a final inspection mechanism.
technical design can refer to:  [Last Mile Checker - Derivative Strategy Projects - Confluence](https://confluence.global.standardchartered.com/display/DSP/Last+Mile+Checker)

currently we are still in **phase **1 which only do technical verification,
in **phase **2 will do business go live then will have one action in cashflow blotter or dashboard; may be as shown in the figure below
![image-2026-7-9_10-28-17.png](attachments/image-2026-7-9_10-28-17.png)

# Dashboard

A Dashboard has been added to provide a Control Tower view of exceptions that require action.

<<This is a handy guide and does not remove the need to monitor and clear the queue directly>>

Group Pending Validation – normally this should automatically get cleared as and when trades are validated. It's useful for Settlements to know if there are cashflows that would flow into Settlement queue post Validation.

**For the rest of the items, Settlements team need to periodically monitor and action the exceptions on timely basis and especially before respective currency payment cut-offs. **Where required, the issue is to be raised to RATAN PSS

![image-2026-5-11_21-41-50-1.png](attachments/image-2026-5-11_21-41-50-1.png)

# FMRP - China Drop 2 (New booking via Blade / STELLA / CFETS)

As part of on going Murex 2.11 decommission work, new trade booking has been enabled via the new FMRP Tech Stack. Deals will be booked either directly in Blade or flown from upstream systems like S2BX / CFETS.

Products in Scope are IRS, CCS, NDF, SCF and FX, only for specific portfolios of Linear Rates Desk and Country = China.

![image2024-5-2_11-19-51.png](attachments/image2024-5-2_11-19-51.png)

Events in Scope are Trade  (New Booking) | Amendment | Withdrawal (Cancellation) | Termination (Full Cancellation with Fee) | Partial Termination (Amendment with Fee) | Close-Out (Only for FX) | Novation (Remaining Party Full) | Portfolio Re-assignment | Expiry (Move from Live to Dead status)

Events Handling in RATAN

| Business Event + Action | Drop 2/Drop3 Handling | Exception |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trade + Book | No event related NSTP rules | - |
| • Trade + Cancel • Withdrawal + Book | NSTP if original cashflow is released, else cancel original | Reversal |
| •Trade + Update •Amendment /Termination / Partial Termination / Novation + Book | NSTP Cancellation & New if original cashflow is released | Cancellation: Reversal New: Rebook |
| Close Out + Book (New Trade ID will be generated) | Close-out trade will flow to RAZOR FX directly | - |
| Portfolio Re-assignment + Book (New Trade ID will be generated) | •All cashflows from Old trade will be cancelled and generated on new trade ID. •Old trade cashflows will be NSTP as ‘REVERSAL’. New trade cashflow will be NSTP as ‘Port Reassign’. Ops to check whether payment was originally sent and if yes, suppress on new trade. Else pay from new trade | Reversal Port Reassign |
| Trade + Revive (Undo) | • Original Payment not Released: Original Cashflow which went to cancelled status will now become live again • Original Payment released, but Cancellation not yet released: Cancellation will be discarded, original cashflow will remain in Released status • Cancellation (MTx92) Released: FO & MO should not be able to do Undo | - |
| Fixing | NSTP if there was another cashflow which was amended post payment release (same period) | Rebook |
| Trade + Expiry | Discard expiry event cashflow | |

Points to Note:

- FX will directly be replicated to RAZOR, and wont flow to RATAN. However, Fees related to FX bookings will still settle in RATAN (same as MX2.11 behavior).
- Settlement Method - DVP: Currently Strategy is used in MX2.11 to identify DVP trades. In FMRP, 'Settlement Method' is used. Exception code will be 'DVP'.** Please settle the cashflows on DVP basis**. - CCP: For IRS deals, 'CCP' Settlement Method will be tagged as below - AGENCY: Deals booked under IR_CFETSAGENCY strategy in MX2.11 In FMRP, this is related to a certain set of trades executed on CFETS with a specific counterparty in HK
- Validation status Exception - Currently in MX2.11, cashflows do not come to settlement queue before validation. - However, in FMRP, cashflows will come to settlement queue same time as it is booked, irrespective of Validation status. - Until Validation status is built into the F2B workflow (expected in early Q3), a NSTP exception "CCS: Check Validation Status" is added for CCS notional payments alone (since only CCS has notional exchange on trade date). - IRS will have interest payments which will be months away before which Validation would be completed). FX, NDF and SCF do not go through Validation in BAU, so not applicable.
- IRS Handling - IRS two leg cashflows from new booking (Fixed+Fixed / Fixed+Floating / Floating+Floating) will get auto netted. - Amendment post payment release: If there is amendment post release of net payment, the reversal & re-book legs will appear separately and need to be netted manually - Cancellation post payment release: In case of outright cancellation, reversal cashflows of two legs will appear in queue separately - the direction will be opposite of the original booking. - If the two reversal cashflows are netted, the net cashflow must not be released from RATAN, as it is not directly linked to the net amount of the original payment - Where required, cancellation message MT192/292/MT199/MT299 should be released via AMH.
- Stella CORP Exception - Currently Settlement Method changes in BLADE are not consumed by RATAN, so a temporary NSTP condition "Stella_Corp_CCS" has been added for CCS trades since only CCS has exchange of currencies - When this exception is encountered, please check if the trade is expected to be settled on DVP basis and handle accordingly
- Portfolio Reassignment: - All cashflows on a trade from the original booking date until final expiry will be cancelled on the old trade ID and booked in new trade ID - Old Trade ID cashflows will show 'Reversal' exception and New Trade ID cashflows will show 'Portfolio Reassignment' exception. - Please check whether payments have been already released on old Trade. If yes, the payment on new trade needs to be suppressed to avoid duplicate payment. - If payment was not released on Old Trade ID, it must be released from the new Trade ID to avoid missed payment.
- FDL, WHT and Adhoc Netting - Previously these exceptions were setup specifically using Murex LABELs. Now they have also been setup based on FMCODE to take effect on STELLA cashflows.
- Fee and Stella Cashflows are temporary exceptions added as a safeguard and will be removed.

# LOANIQ Highlights

**How to identify LOANIQ cashflow**

- Trade original source system value is "LOANIQ", user can create customize filter to get LOANIQ data ![image2024-11-6_10-51-49.png](attachments/image2024-11-6_10-51-49.png)![image2024-11-6_10-53-6.png](attachments/image2024-11-6_10-53-6.png)
- Product Taxonomy in ("Credit:LoansTermLoan", "CreditLoans:RevolvingTermLoan"), user can select the value in quick search section ![image2024-11-6_10-55-0.png](attachments/image2024-11-6_10-55-0.png)

**LOANIQ specific process:**

- Cashflow received with "Affirmed" status, no user affirmation or trade confirmation required
- There is no amendment/withdrawal cashflow event for LOANIQ. - To withdrawal any payment, user will book new opposite direction cashflow for it - In case of amendment there is an adjustment cashflow generated instead of withdrawal + new
- Swift/Accounting is generated in Razor and send to FMSRE
- Tag20 prefix is LQ in swift message
- User should not net LOANIQ cashflow with other FMRP cashflow
- New attributes - **Is Netting Required** (for LOANIQ) - Indicator to show if netting required. There is NSTP rule created in RATAN to hold the cashflow if the value is true.

- - **General Ledger Owner Id **（for LOANIQ）- Indicator to link the payment in LOANIQ. If the cashflow hit "Netting Required" exception, ops user should check and net the cashflow with the same general ledger owner id.

**Vostro SI **

- LOANIQ vostro SI are maintained separately from existing Murex SIs
- Loaniq SSI should be maintained with XQXXXX security in SSI + (XQXXXX security is mapped to XQ**** CFI code)
- if SC prefix required for specific SSI having sort code, the value should be updated in SSI+
- FEDWIRE SSI - for initial go live existing and new Fedwire SSI will not contain the fedwire number as this is not mandatory for settlement. Once Ratan is able to handle it, this process can be revisited.
- Loan ops will handle the process of Loaniq SSI maintenance

**DO not use SwiftSuppress **

- Razor flow does not allow swift suppress option - its result is same as Cashflow Suppress

**Temporary NSTP after initial go live**

- Loaniq cashflows will be NSTP for an initial period similar to how all SLT cashflows are NSTP in Murex
- Loan ops will provide SSI details for settlement via mail similar to Murex
- Sett ops to verify the SSI attached accordingly or add SSI as per loan ops instruction

# Interface Issues Handling

**MX2.11 to RATAN**

- Realtime Ack / Nack exists between MX2.11 and RATAN
- When Cashflows are published from MX2.11, they are moved to SNTR status
- When Cashflows are released from RATAN, a status update is sent to MX2.11 to move the cashflows to RLSR status for hard block purpose
- In case Ack is not received within OLA (5 minutes), an alert will be given to PSS who will investigate the issue
- In case required, PSS will advise Settlements team, who need to right click on cashflow and re-trigger the status update to MX2.11

![statuswriteback.JPG](attachments/statuswriteback.JPG)

**RATAN to RAZOR**

- Ack / Nack exists between RATAN and RAZOR for non-FMRP cashflow
- Any OLA break will be monitored by PSS via ITRS
- If there is loss of message due to interface issue, Settlements team can right click and re-publish the Cashflow to RAZOR on advise from PSS

**RATAN to FMSGW**

- Ack / Nack exists between RATAN and FMSGW for FMRP cashflow
- Any OLA break will be monitored by PSS via ITRS
