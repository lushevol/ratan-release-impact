# Background

As the FMRP 2024 roadmap Ratan is going to build the capacity generating swift message, Ratan would take the cashflow + SSI(Vostro & Nostro) and generate the swift message. As agreed in the FMRP programme level, Ratan will send the swift message to FM Swift Gateway and

they will take responsibility to communicate with AMH/SCPAY and return the ACK/NACK to Ratan.

# Query Swift Message From UI

- MT message generated from Ratan (CN,MY,IN, partial SG) - Query from Ratan with cashflow ID
- MT message generated from Razor (LOANIQ, EG, NP, SA) - Query from FMSRE with tag20
- MX message generated from Ratan - Query with cashflow ID (SG) – Query from Ratan with cashflow ID

# Cashflow/Swift Status Event

| Swift Generation Failed for different reason: 1. technical issue 2. validation failed | READY (will be changed to FAILED by EOD job) | Pending Ack | Ratan Internal Error | If latest response received for both swift msg are the same, set the value to the same as received sub status else set the field to "Check in FMSGW" or "Check in FMSRE" | {Swift Error Description} |
| Swift send to MX process | READY | Pending Ack | Pending MX Ack | |
| tech ack from MX generation | READY | Pending Ack | MX Generation Received | |
| MX generation failed | READY | Pending Ack | MX Generation Error | |
| MX message sent to FMSRE | RELEASED | | Pending FMSRE Ack | |

- Technical ACK/NACK is expected from FMSWIFTGATEWAY within 5 mins as the timeout setup.

Basic header block identifier is 2. | 3c | 2 | | | Separator | M | The character : indicates the end of the block identifier. | Colon : | : | | 1 | Input / Output ID | M | For an input message, the Input/Output Identifier consists of the single letter 'I' | 1a | I | | 2 | SWIFT Message Type | M | BIC of receiver | 3n | 103 | | 3 | Destination Address | M | This address is the 12-character SWIFT address of the receiver of the message. It defines the destination to which the message should be sent. | 12x | SCBLCNSXXXXX | | 4 | Priority | O | This character, used within FIN Application Headers only, defines the priority with which a message is delivered. The possible values are: S = System U = Urgent N = Normal | 1a | U | | 5 | Delivery Monitoring | O | Delivery monitoring options apply only to FIN user-to-user messages. The chosen option is expressed as a single digit: 1 = Non-Delivery Warning 2 = Delivery Notification 3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification If the message has priority 'U', the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2' or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring. | 1x | 3 | | 6 | Obsolescence Period | O | The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated. The values for the obsolescence period are: 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. | 3n | 003 | | | End of block indicator | M | The Block identifier end tag | Right curly bracket | } |
