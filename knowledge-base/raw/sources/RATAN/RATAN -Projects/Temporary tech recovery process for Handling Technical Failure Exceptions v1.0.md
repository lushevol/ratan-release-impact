****Purpose****

---

This process defines the governance, ownership, and control requirements for situations where PSS is required to perform temporary technical recovery for tech failure exceptions in RATAN. The purpose is to ensure that such recovery remains strictly controlled, exceptional, and temporary, while permanent remediation is prioritized and delivered by Dev.

**Scope**

---

- Only strategic flow cashflows failed due to technical reasons will be following this process.
- BCS flow excluded, and process remain as it is for Ops team to replay.
- Data issue and business exceptions excluded, process remain as per Ops team BAU or MO to correct data.

**Exception-only principle**

---

Any technical recovery performed by PSS must be treated as a temporary and exceptional measure. It must not become part of the standard BAU operating model or a substitute for permanent technical remediation.

**Ownership and Responsibilities**

- Ownership must remain clearly separated as follows: - **PSS**: may execute temporary technical recovery only where this has been explicitly agreed, documented, and approved. - **Development**: owns root cause analysis, recovery design, permanent fix delivery, and automation. - **Ops**: validates replay or recovery outcome where business confirmation is required. - **MO/Business: **Dummy/amend or cancel/rebook trades when required This model is intended to preserve clear accountability and prevent temporary operational workarounds from becoming enduring support responsibilities.

**Risk acceptance**

---

Where PSS is required to perform temporary technical recovery, the relevant Business Owner and/or Product Owner must explicitly acknowledge that this represents a temporary, risk-bearing workaround pending permanent remediation.

Email approval to be attached here:

**Recovery steps approval**

---

All temporary recovery steps must:

- be documented in Confluence
- be reviewed and approved by the relevant Product Owner before use
- be executed only in line with the approved procedure

**Prioritization Rules for Permanent Fix**

---

Permanent fix prioritization should follow the rules below:

- If the issue results in a **P4 or higher incident**, or the **same issue occurs twice within one week**, it must be addressed within the same week through either: - an ECR, or a quick fix (If lead time allows, a normal CR may be considered)
- If manual replay or recovery is required **more than three times within one month**, a permanent fix must be implemented within **one month**.
- In all other cases, if PSS repeatedly performs the same technical recovery, the issue must be reclassified as **resilience / control debt**. Such items should be prioritized above normal enhancement backlog items. Ownership of the repeated manual task should also be reviewed and reassessed.

**Review cadence**

---

All tracked technical recovery exceptions, together with the related permanent fix items, must be reviewed during the **KTLO prioritization call every two weeks**.

**Escalation path**
If the agreed target date for the permanent fix slips, the issue must be escalated to:  **Development Head / ****PSS Head / CPO**

**Tracking Mechanism**

---

Each technical failure exception that requires temporary PSS recovery must be tracked with the following minimum controls:

- an **ADO ticket**
- a named **Development owner**
- a committed **ETA for permanent fix**

This is to ensure that all temporary recoveries remain visible, governed, and actively tracked to closure.

**Expected End State**

---

The target end state is that recurring technical failure exceptions are addressed through permanent technical fixes or automation, such that PSS no longer needs to perform temporary technical recovery.

**Management Intention**
This process is intended to provide a controlled interim mechanism for service continuity while ensuring that recurring technical failures are resolved at source. It is not intended to transfer long-term technical recovery ownership to PSS.
